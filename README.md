# Silent Scream Detector

This project aims to detect visual cues of psychological distress from webcam video using computer vision and machine learning.

## Objective
To develop a system capable of identifying facial and postural indicators of silent emotional distress (e.g., silent screams, slouching, hands near face) from short video clips.

## Dataset
- Custom dataset generated by capturing short webcam videos
- Extracted image frames labeled as:
  - `0`: Calm
  - `1`: Distress
- Features extracted from face and pose landmarks

## Tools & Libraries

| Purpose           | Library             |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Frame Capture     | OpenCV              |
| Landmark Detection| MediaPipe           |
| Data Processing   | pandas, NumPy       |
| ML Model          | scikit-learn        |
| Visualization     | matplotlib, seaborn |
| Prototyping       | Jupyter Notebooks   |

## Features Extracted
- Eye openness
- Mouth openness
- Shoulder tilt (posture)
- Hand-to-face distance

## Workflow
1. Record webcam videos (`OpenCV`)
2. Extract frames
3. Detect face/pose landmarks (`MediaPipe`)
4. Calculate numerical features
5. Label and store features
6. Train classifier (`Random Forest`)
7. Evaluate and iterate
